SmartInvest Overview:

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive set of financial indicators that accurately predict the performance of the S&P 500 index and its eleven constituent sectors. Additionally, the team will develop a sentiment analysis indicator using textual data from financial news headlines. The project will be divided into four work streams, assigned to participating students, ensuring thorough coverage of all project aspects. It involves data acquisition, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning model development, and the synthesis of findings. The primary data source for this project will be the S&P 500 and its sectors, supplemented by the exploration of news headline correlation through web scraping and sentiment analysis.

The project involves data acquisition, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, machine learning model development, and the synthesis of the findings.

The S&P 500 and its sectors will serve as our primary data source for this project. Additionally, we'll explore potential impact factors on the FOMC's decisions, including employment data and inflation indicators.

**Work Streams**

**1. Jorge Vido: Sector Analysis - IT, Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials**

Tasks:

- Perform individual analysis of the stated sectors and their relationship with the S&P 500 index.
- Carry out data wrangling to clean and prepare sector data for analysis.
- Conduct EDA to understand sector data characteristics and behaviors.
- Perform statistical analysis on sector data.
- Utilize machine learning to identify patterns and relationships between the sectors and S&P 500.

**2. Jesus Cruz: Sector Analysis - Industrials, Communication Services, Consumer Staples, and Energy**

Tasks:

- Follow the same process as above for these respective sectors.

**3. Israel Garcia: Sector Analysis - Utilities, Materials, and Real Estate**

Tasks:

- Follow the same process as above for these respective sectors.


**4. Christian Verges: Data Acquisition, Sentiment Analysis & Project Planning**

Tasks:

- Perform project management responsibilities. 
-Organized and outline schedule for the 6 week project. 
- Lead the data scraping efforts to collect necessary data from financial news outlets.
- Conduct sentiment analysis using pre-trained models for bullish, neutral, and bearish sentiment.
- Work closely with the team to plan, coordinate, and ensure data consistency across all streams.
- Assist with domain research and data discovery to aid comprehensive analysis.

All team members will need to familiarize themselves with HTML for data scraping and pre-trained sentiment models to enhance their sector or indicator analysis. 

The project will span six weeks, during which regular checkpoints should be scheduled to monitor progress and address any emerging challenges.
