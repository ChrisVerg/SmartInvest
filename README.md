## Project Summary

The overall objective of this project is to create a comprehensive series of financial indicators focused on predicting the discount rate decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), as influenced by the performance of the S&P 500 index and its eleven constituent sectors. The project will be divided into six work streams to cater for six participating students, each with a unique focus to ensure all areas of the project are comprehensively covered. 

The project involves data acquisition, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, machine learning model development, and the synthesis of the findings.

The S&P 500 and its sectors will serve as our primary data source for this project. Additionally, we'll explore potential impact factors on the FOMC's decisions, including employment data and inflation indicators.

**Work Streams**

**1. Klarissa Arroyo: Sector Analysis - IT, Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials**

Tasks:

- Perform individual analysis of the stated sectors and their relationship with the S&P 500 index.
- Carry out data wrangling to clean and prepare sector data for analysis.
- Conduct EDA to understand sector data characteristics and behaviors.
- Perform statistical analysis on sector data.
- Utilize machine learning to identify patterns and relationships between the sectors and S&P 500.

**2. Jesus Cruz: Sector Analysis - Industrials, Communication Services, Consumer Staples, and Energy**

Tasks:

- Follow the same process as above for these respective sectors.

**3. Israel Garcia: Sector Analysis - Utilities, Materials, and Real Estate**

Tasks:

- Follow the same process as above for these respective sectors.

**4. Jorge Vido: S&P 500 Index Analysis & Federal Reserve Discount Rates**

Tasks:

- Perform a comprehensive analysis of the S&P 500 index.
- Analyze the Federal Reserve's discount rates and its potential impact on the S&P 500.
- Use statistical techniques to identify significant indicators.
- Apply machine learning models to predict future index behaviors based on historical data and discount rate patterns.

**5. Samondria Wilson: Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate Analysis**

Tasks:

- Investigate factors influencing the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.
- Perform data wrangling, EDA, and statistical analysis on employment data, job creation data, labor market participation, and inflation indicators.
- Use machine learning techniques to forecast future changes in these indicators.

**6. Christian Verges: Data Acquisition, Sentiment Analysis & Project Planning**

Tasks:

- Lead the data scraping efforts to collect necessary data from financial news outlets.
- Conduct sentiment analysis using pre-trained models for bullish, neutral, and bearish sentiment.
- Work closely with the team to plan, coordinate, and ensure data consistency across all streams.
- Assist with domain research and data discovery to aid comprehensive analysis.

All team members will need to familiarize themselves with HTML for data scraping and pre-trained sentiment models to enhance their sector or indicator analysis. The overall analysis should culminate in an interactive dashboard that can serve as a guide to predicting the FOMC's discount rate decisions, including actionable insights into each sector's unique characteristics. This will include predictions from Random Forest or other suitable models. Furthermore, it's crucial to understand the Federal Reserve's history, mandates, and decision-making indicators to contextualize our findings accurately. 

The project will span six weeks, during which regular checkpoints should be scheduled to monitor progress and address any emerging challenges.
