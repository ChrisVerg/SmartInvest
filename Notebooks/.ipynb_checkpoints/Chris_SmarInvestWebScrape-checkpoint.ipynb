    ">This abstract presents the utilization of the BeautifulSoup Python library to web scrape textual data from the CNBC financial news outlet. The scraped data serves as the foundation for developing a sentiment indicator aimed at stock market analysis. By extracting relevant financial news articles and employing sentiment analysis techniques, sentiment scores are assigned to the text, indicating whether the sentiment expressed in the articles is positive, negative, or neutral. These sentiment scores can be aggregated over time to create a sentiment indicator, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and assisting traders and investors in making informed decisions."
