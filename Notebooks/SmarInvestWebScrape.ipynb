    ">This abstract presents the utilization of the BeautifulSoup Python library to web scrape textual data from the CNBC financial news outlet. The scraped data serves as the foundation for developing a sentiment indicator aimed at stock market analysis. By extracting relevant financial news articles and employing sentiment analysis techniques, sentiment scores are assigned to the text, indicating whether the sentiment expressed in the articles is positive, negative, or neutral. These sentiment scores can be aggregated over time to create a sentiment indicator, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and assisting traders and investors in making informed decisions."

Tech and growth sectors were \"smack dab in the middle,\" said Calvasina, RBC's head of U.S. equity strategy.\"I do think tech gets hurt, but it probably holds up better than some of those more cyclically oriented areas if we don't get a deal,\" she added.— Darla Mercado22 Hours AgoMcCarthy and Biden meet as debt ceiling looms on marketsPresident Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy spoke to reporters around when they were scheduled to meet about the debt ceiling.Biden said he was hopeful about progress and emphasized the need to ensure tax loopholes are closed so wealthy people pay a fair share of taxes. McCarthy said he was looking forward to finding common ground, after saying earlier in the day that decisions have to be made at the meeting.Investors have been watching for updates on progress out of debt ceiling negotiations amid concerns for what a default could mean for the economy.— Alex Harring22 Hours AgoYellen's latest guidance: 'Highly likely' Treasury will be unable to cover debts in early June Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has just released a new letter to congressional leaders with updated guidance on the earliest date that the U.S. could be at serious risk of a debt default. The date remains June 1 in the new letter, the same date it's been since the start of May. But the new message contains two key differences from a very similar letter Yellen penned on May 15.\"With an additional week of information now available, I am writing to note that we estimate that it is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government's obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by earlyJune, and potentially as early as June 1,\" writes Yellen.The phrase \"highly likely\" is new. Last week Yellen wrote that it was merely \"likely.\" Yellen also removed an entire sentence from last week's letter that said emergency measures Treasury is currently taking could help to push that June deadline out.\"The actual date Treasury exhausts extraordinary measures could be a number of days or weeks later than these estimates,\" read Yellen's May 15 letter to congressional leaders. The new letter comes as President Joe Biden is about to meet face to face with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, part of an increasingly urgent effort to reach a bipartisan compromise deal.— Christina Wilkie 22 Hours AgoStock futures are up slightlyStock futures were modestly higher shortly after 6 p.m. ET.Futures tied to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all up 0.1%.— Alex HarringSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Some House Republicans on Tuesday questioned the accuracy of this projected default date.On Monday, Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden met at the White House, in a discussion that the House speaker described as \"productive\" and \"professional,\" although the hourlong talk concluded without a resolution.\"We are sending a very negative signal about our ability to run our economy, let alone be a anchor for the rest of the world,\" Mohamed El-Erian said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"And the market so far has actually dealt with it very well.\"The Allianz chief economic advisor said he's \"very impressed\" by the recent market stability. El-Erian added that he views the S&P 500 as fairly priced despite this recent headwind and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's next rate move.While lawmakers should achieve a resolution to the debt ceiling woes, Aspiriant's Sandi Bragar remains cautious as recession fears persist. Recent history suggests a downturn will likely come when the Federal Reserve completes its hiking cycle, she added.\"Everyone just feels like there is a party in the market and wanting to participate,\" the chief client officer said. \"I don't think that it's really time to get too excited just yet.

Tech and growth sectors were \"smack dab in the middle,\" said Calvasina, RBC's head of U.S. equity strategy.\"I do think tech gets hurt, but it probably holds up better than some of those more cyclically oriented areas if we don't get a deal,\" she added.— Darla Mercado22 Hours AgoMcCarthy and Biden meet as debt ceiling looms on marketsPresident Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy spoke to reporters around when they were scheduled to meet about the debt ceiling.Biden said he was hopeful about progress and emphasized the need to ensure tax loopholes are closed so wealthy people pay a fair share of taxes. McCarthy said he was looking forward to finding common ground, after saying earlier in the day that decisions have to be made at the meeting.Investors have been watching for updates on progress out of debt ceiling negotiations amid concerns for what a default could mean for the economy.— Alex Harring22 Hours AgoYellen's latest guidance: 'Highly likely' Treasury will be unable to cover debts in early June Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has just released a new letter to congressional leaders with updated guidance on the earliest date that the U.S. could be at serious risk of a debt default. The date remains June 1 in the new letter, the same date it's been since the start of May. But the new message contains two key differences from a very similar letter Yellen penned on May 15.\"With an additional week of information now available, I am writing to note that we estimate that it is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government's obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by earlyJune, and potentially as early as June 1,\" writes Yellen.The phrase \"highly likely\" is new. Last week Yellen wrote that it was merely \"likely.\" Yellen also removed an entire sentence from last week's letter that said emergency measures Treasury is currently taking could help to push that June deadline out.\"The actual date Treasury exhausts extraordinary measures could be a number of days or weeks later than these estimates,\" read Yellen's May 15 letter to congressional leaders. The new letter comes as President Joe Biden is about to meet face to face with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, part of an increasingly urgent effort to reach a bipartisan compromise deal.— Christina Wilkie 22 Hours AgoStock futures are up slightlyStock futures were modestly higher shortly after 6 p.m. ET.Futures tied to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all up 0.1%.— Alex HarringSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

If you look at the map, the states we need, he is losing or has lost previously,\" he later added.Records show that Lambert has also donated to the Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC and Trump's campaign.Jay Zeidman, a managing partner at health care investment firm Altitude Ventures, is also listed as a DeSantis campaign fundraiser.
