    ">This abstract presents the utilization of the BeautifulSoup Python library to web scrape textual data from the CNBC financial news outlet. The scraped data serves as the foundation for developing a sentiment indicator aimed at stock market analysis. By extracting relevant financial news articles and employing sentiment analysis techniques, sentiment scores are assigned to the text, indicating whether the sentiment expressed in the articles is positive, negative, or neutral. These sentiment scores can be aggregated over time to create a sentiment indicator, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and assisting traders and investors in making informed decisions."

Here's why the experts like itMarket MoversStocks fell Tuesday as ongoing debt ceiling discussions appeared to yield little progress.The S&P 500 dropped 1.12% to settle at 4,145.58, while the Nasdaq Composite pulled back 1.26% to close at 12,560.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 231.07 points, or 0.69%, to finish at 33,055.51.Some traders interpreted the lack of any major updates on negotiations as a sign that lawmakers, perhaps, are struggling to progress as hoped.CNBCInvestors have been closely eyeing debt-limit negotiations in Washington, hoping for more certainty as the so-called June 1 X-date expected by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen fast approaches. Some House Republicans on Tuesday questioned the accuracy of this projected default date.On Monday, Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden met at the White House, in a discussion that the House speaker described as \"productive\" and \"professional,\" although the hourlong talk concluded without a resolution.\"We are sending a very negative signal about our ability to run our economy, let alone be a anchor for the rest of the world,\" Mohamed El-Erian said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"And the market so far has actually dealt with it very well.\"The Allianz chief economic advisor said he's \"very impressed\" by the recent market stability. El-Erian added that he views the S&P 500 as fairly priced despite this recent headwind and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's next rate move.While lawmakers should achieve a resolution to the debt ceiling woes, Aspiriant's Sandi Bragar remains cautious as recession fears persist. Recent history suggests a downturn will likely come when the Federal Reserve completes its hiking cycle, she added.\"Everyone just feels like there is a party in the market and wanting to participate,\" the chief client officer said. \"I don't think that it's really time to get too excited just yet. There's reason to be cautious here.\"Elsewhere, Apple moved 1.5% lower after announcing a multibillion-dollar chip production deal with Broadcom. The chip stock gained 1.2%. Yelp popped 5.7% as an activist investor called for the company to explore a sale.—CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.21 Min AgoStocks finish lower on Tuesday, S&P 500 drops 1.1%Stocks sold off on Tuesday as debt ceiling negotiations pressed on.The S&P 500 dropped 1.12% to settle at 4,145.67, while the  Nasdaq Composite shed 1.26% to close at 12,560.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 231.01 points, or 0.69%, to finish at 33,055.57.— Samantha Subin42 Min AgoConsumer staples, utilities vulnerable to backup in bond yields, Strategas saysConsumer staples and utility stocks are vulnerable to this month's backup in 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields, said Chris Verrone, head of technical and macro research at Strategas Securities.\"Rates have continued to show some life over the last few weeks, and with upward pressure on yields has come downward pressure to Staples and Utilities both of which traded to multi month relative performance lows\" on Monday, Verrone wrote in a note Tuesday. Utility stocks are faring worse than staples, \"spending much of the last 6 months below the 200-day [moving average] and home to some pronounced top formations at the individual stock level.\"Ten-year Treasury note yields touched 3.725% on Tuesday, the highest since March 13, and about 46 basis points higher just since April 6. A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Utility Index is down almost 5% in May (second worse only to energy stocks), S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks are off by 4.2% in May, while the S&P 500 Index is down only 0.5% this month.— Scott Schnipper, Michael Bloom50 Min AgoBlackRock launches two active ETFs, including a fund run by Rick RiederBlackRock debuted two actively managed ETFs on Tuesday, managed by two of the asset management giant's top investors.The BlackRock's Flexible Income ETF (BINC) is managed by Rick Rieder, the firm's CIO of global fixed income. The actively managed fund has a net expense ratio of 0.40%, and is aiming for a yield of 7%.BlackRock also debuted an active equity fund.

Some House Republicans on Tuesday questioned the accuracy of this projected default date.On Monday, Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden met at the White House, in a discussion that the House speaker described as \"productive\" and \"professional,\" although the hourlong talk concluded without a resolution.\"We are sending a very negative signal about our ability to run our economy, let alone be a anchor for the rest of the world,\" Mohamed El-Erian said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"And the market so far has actually dealt with it very well.\"The Allianz chief economic advisor said he's \"very impressed\" by the recent market stability.

Ron DeSantis is gearing up to announce his presidential campaign, as he tries to catch up to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in the polls.DeSantis' campaign has put together a list of business leaders and Republican donors to raise money for his 2024 run. Multiple DeSantis bundlers supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's failed White House bid in 2016.Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis celebrates onstage during his 2022 U.S. midterm elections night party in Tampa, Florida, November 8, 2022.Marco Bello | ReutersGov. Ron DeSantis has assembled a team of wealthy business leaders to help raise money for his presidential campaign, according to a partial list of fundraisers provided by a senior political official with the Florida Republican.The bundler list, which was first provided to CNBC, includes business leaders from industries ranging from real estate to finance. DeSantis is set to announce his run for president Wednesday evening during a Twitter discussion with the social media platform's owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Bundlers will gather at the Four Seasons hotel in Miami from Wednesday through Friday. They'll receive briefings from campaign staff and call around to raise money for the campaign, NBC News reported. DeSantis is considered Donald Trump's biggest rival in the GOP primary, although the former president has held a healthy lead in recent polls.The DeSantis campaign's bundler list includes David Horowitz, the chairman of the Horowitz Group, a family office and real estate investment firm based in California. Horowitz did not return a request for comment.Horowitz has previously donated $25,000 to the pro-DeSantis PAC Friends of Ron DeSantis, which was rebranded with new leadership as the Florida governor moved to launch his bid for the White House. During the 2020 election, Horowitz contributed just over $35,000 to the Republican National Committee and at least $2,800 to Trump's failed campaign, according to data from nonpartisan site OpenSecrets.Hal Lambert, the founder of investment management firm Point Bridge Capital, is also on the list.Lambert's firm created the MAGA ETF, an exchange traded fund that's advertised as a way for people to invest in companies that align with Republican political beliefs. Lambert served on Trump's Inaugural Committee and was a national finance chair for Trump's successful 2016 campaign for president, according to his website.\"I certainly think north of $500k of hard dollars is very possible for me,\" Lambert said in an email when asked how much he is aiming to raise for DeSantis. \"I want to win in November and I don't think Trump will win. If you look at the map, the states we need, he is losing or has lost previously,\" he later added.Records show that Lambert has also donated to the Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC and Trump's campaign.Jay Zeidman, a managing partner at health care investment firm Altitude Ventures, is also listed as a DeSantis campaign fundraiser. Zeidman did not return a request for comment.Zeidman previously donated to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's failed campaign for president, according to OpenSecrets. The New York Times reports that Zeidman is friends with Bush's son, George P. Bush.Frank Mermoud, the president of Orpheus International, is also a member of the DeSantis bundler team, according to the list provided to CNBC. Records show that he, too, was a supporter of Bush's failed primary run for president in 2016.Mermoud could not be reached for comment.watch nowVIDEO4:2804:28Disney tells its lobbyists to step up fight against Florida Gov.

Ron DeSantis is gearing up to announce his presidential campaign, as he tries to catch up to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in the polls.DeSantis' campaign has put together a list of business leaders and Republican donors to raise money for his 2024 run. Multiple DeSantis bundlers supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's failed White House bid in 2016.Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis celebrates onstage during his 2022 U.S. midterm elections night party in Tampa, Florida, November 8, 2022.Marco Bello | ReutersGov. Ron DeSantis has assembled a team of wealthy business leaders to help raise money for his presidential campaign, according to a partial list of fundraisers provided by a senior political official with the Florida Republican.The bundler list, which was first provided to CNBC, includes business leaders from industries ranging from real estate to finance. DeSantis is set to announce his run for president Wednesday evening during a Twitter discussion with the social media platform's owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Bundlers will gather at the Four Seasons hotel in Miami from Wednesday through Friday. They'll receive briefings from campaign staff and call around to raise money for the campaign, NBC News reported. DeSantis is considered Donald Trump's biggest rival in the GOP primary, although the former president has held a healthy lead in recent polls.The DeSantis campaign's bundler list includes David Horowitz, the chairman of the Horowitz Group, a family office and real estate investment firm based in California. Horowitz did not return a request for comment.Horowitz has previously donated $25,000 to the pro-DeSantis PAC Friends of Ron DeSantis, which was rebranded with new leadership as the Florida governor moved to launch his bid for the White House. During the 2020 election, Horowitz contributed just over $35,000 to the Republican National Committee and at least $2,800 to Trump's failed campaign, according to data from nonpartisan site OpenSecrets.Hal Lambert, the founder of investment management firm Point Bridge Capital, is also on the list.Lambert's firm created the MAGA ETF, an exchange traded fund that's advertised as a way for people to invest in companies that align with Republican political beliefs. Lambert served on Trump's Inaugural Committee and was a national finance chair for Trump's successful 2016 campaign for president, according to his website.\"I certainly think north of $500k of hard dollars is very possible for me,\" Lambert said in an email when asked how much he is aiming to raise for DeSantis. \"I want to win in November and I don't think Trump will win. If you look at the map, the states we need, he is losing or has lost previously,\" he later added.Records show that Lambert has also donated to the Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC and Trump's campaign.Jay Zeidman, a managing partner at health care investment firm Altitude Ventures, is also listed as a DeSantis campaign fundraiser. Zeidman did not return a request for comment.Zeidman previously donated to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's failed campaign for president, according to OpenSecrets. The New York Times reports that Zeidman is friends with Bush's son, George P. Bush.Frank Mermoud, the president of Orpheus International, is also a member of the DeSantis bundler team, according to the list provided to CNBC. Records show that he, too, was a supporter of Bush's failed primary run for president in 2016.Mermoud could not be reached for comment.watch nowVIDEO4:2804:28Disney tells its lobbyists to step up fight against Florida Gov.

       "'An 8-year-old girl died after suffering a \"medical emergency\" while in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas on Wednesday, authorities said.The girl and her family were being held at a facility in the city of Harlingen, near the Mexico border, Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. No more details have been released about the girl\\'s identity.\"Emergency Medical Services were called to the station and transported her to the local hospital where she was pronounced dead,\" the statement said, adding that the Office of Professional Responsibility would conduct an investigation as is standard protocol in the case of a death. Illegal border crossings declined yesterday as tensions grow in citiesMay 16, 202301:28The agency said it had contacted the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the Harlingen Police Department about the incident.Sgt. Larry Moore, a spokesman for the Harlingen Police Department, told the Associated Press he had no information about the death.The death comes days after a 17-year-old unaccompanied migrant from Honduras died at a facility run by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement in Florida.The Honduran government named him as Ángel Eduardo Maradiaga Espinoza and called for a full investigation and a criminal investigation if any wrongdoing is found.On May 12, Title 42 was lifted — a Covid-19 pandemic-related restriction that put limits on immigration. Amid fears of a big influx of migrants, and after an initial surge, the numbers returned to normal.Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant secretary for border & immigration policy at the Department for Homeland Security, told reporters in a briefing Wednesday that the daily average of “\\xa0“encounters” with migrants seeking to cross the border since May 12 had fallen from more than 10,000 to just over 4,400, including less than 4,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday.\"This represents a decrease of 56%, or less than half of the average encountered in the four days leading up to the title the lifting of Title 42 when the Border Patrol encountered an average of 10,100 individuals each day,\" he said.In the four days after Title 42 was lifted, Border Patrol processed and released more than 6,000 migrants into the U.S. without court dates or the ability to track them.Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala are currently the most popular countries of origin for migrants attempting to cross the border, he said.'"

The CFPB said in its suit that the bank automatically denied fraud claims and billing error notices in certain circumstances.In addition, Citizens neglected to fully refund charges and fees, and the bank failed to issue mandatory acknowledgement letters and denial notices in response to billing errors, according to the lawsuit.\"Federal law provides important rights to credit cardholders when disputing transactions and resolving billing errors,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"As outstanding credit card debt approaches $1 trillion, the CFPB will be closely watching the conduct of the credit card industry.\"Under TILA, credit card issuers are required to investigate all fraud claims and refund the amount in question plus any associated fees if unauthorized use is found. But Citizens automatically denied unauthorized use claims and billing error notices to customers who failed to return the bank's fraud affidavit, according to the judgment.Automatic denials also were issued when consumers refused or could not comply with a statute requiring notarization for the affidavit or the promise to appear in court, the suit said. In addition, CFPB said Citizens rerouted requests for referrals to credit counseling organizations from its designated toll-free line to general customer service or collections based on account status. The malpractice began in at least 2010 and persisted into early 2016, according to the suit.Citizens Bank noted that the issue involved a small subset of its credit card customers.\"While Citizens continues to disagree with the CFPB's stance with respect to these long-resolved issues, which were self-identified and voluntarily addressed years ago, we are pleased to put this matter behind us,\" said Polly Klane, general counsel of Citizens.Apart from the $9 million penalty to the CFPB's victims relief fund, Citizens must ensure its credit card practices comply with the law and cease enacting the fraud affidavit, according to the release.Citizens Bank is among the 15 largest consumer banks in the U.S. with branches and ATMs in 14 states and Washington, D.C. It is a subsidiary of Citizens Financial Group, which reported $222 billion in assets as of March 31.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
